# Feed reader testing
This is part of Udacity's Front-end Web Developement nanodegree projects.This project tests knowledge in use a testing suite to validate code. Project starts with a Feed Reader App and goal is write test spec in Jasmine.

## Udacity instruction
In this project you are given a web-based application that reads RSS feeds. The original developer of this application clearly saw the value in testing, they've already included [Jasmine](https://jasmine.github.io/) and even started writing their first test suite! Unfortunately, they decided to move on to start their own company and we're now left with an application with an incomplete test suite. That's where you come in.
